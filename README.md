portfolio in-progress

This is my portfolio, which is a work in progress built primarily on HTML5 and CSS3,
The intention is to update it to be a dynamic experience for visitors by implementing JavaScript
and various frameworks, as well as defining a set domain with a .com and deployment using Vercel
to allow the DOM to render and be easily accessible and interactive beyond the current state.
